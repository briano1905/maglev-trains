    <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
    <p>Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets, one set to repel and push the train up off the track, then another set to move the 'floating train' ahead at great speed taking advantage of the lack of friction. Along certain &quot;medium range&quot; routes (usually 200 to 400 miles (320 to 640 km)) Maglev can compete favorably with high-speed rail and airplanes.</p>

    <p>Understand the basic underlying physics of magnetic levitation. introduces the challenge and methods of levitation.</p>
    <h3 id="intro-1">Intro</h3>
    <p>Magnetic levitation, maglev, or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.</p>
    <h3 id="stability">Stability</h3>
    <p>Static stability means that any small displacement away from a stable equilibrium causes a net force to push it back to the equilibrium point.</p>
    <p>Dynamic stability occurs when the levitation system is able to damp out any vibration-like motion that may occur.</p>

    <p>Good explanation on the EMS system and how they are used to operate maglev trains.</p>
    <h3 id="intro-2">Intro</h3>
    <p>Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) is the magnetic levitation of an object achieved by constantly altering the strength of a magnetic field produced by electromagnets using a feedback loop. In most cases the levitation effect is mostly due to permanent magnets as they don't have any power dissipation, with electromagnets only used to stabilize the effect.</p>

    <p>Build basic understanding on the EDS system and how they work to use in maglev trains.</p>
    <h3 id="intro-3">Intro</h3>
    <p>Electrodynamic suspension (EDS) is a form of magnetic levitation in which there are conductors which are exposed to time-varying magnetic fields. This induces eddy currents in the conductors that creates a repulsive magnetic field which holds the two objects apart.</p>
    <h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
    <p>In EDS maglev trains, both the rail and the train exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive force between these magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the train is produced by either superconducting magnets (as in SCMaglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of the repulsive maglev systems is that they are naturally stable - minor narrowing in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to repel the magnets back to their original position, while a slight increase in distance greatly reduces the force and again returns the vehicle to the right separation. No feedback control is necessarily needed.</p>

    <p>Excellent summation on electromagnetic propulsion, the physics behind them and how it is used to propel maglev train.</p>
    <h3 id="intro-4">Intro</h3>
    <p>Electromagnetic propulsion (EMP), is the principle of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a field, which can then be repelled. When a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon.</p>
    <h3 id="uses-1">Uses</h3>
    <p>In a maglev train the primary coil assembly lies below the reaction plate. There is a 1–10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for speeds up to 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back.</p>
